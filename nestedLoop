L1:
	
	mov eax,0 
	mov edx,0
	mov ecx,ebx ; outside loop counter
	mov iVal,ecx; moving ecx to iVal as loop repeats so that the right nubers are added together inside of loop
	mov edi,3 ; resetting edi to 3 for loop purposess
L2:
	mov ecx,edi ;resetting inside loop ecx value to 3 so that it always loops 3 times for each outside loop
	mov jVal,ecx ; moving ecx to jVal for addition
	mov eax,jVal ; cant add memory to memory so im moving jVal to register first
	add eax,iVal ; jVal + iVal
	add y[esi],eax ; moving jVal+iVal to a place in the array using indirect adressing
	dec edi ; 
	add esi,TYPE jVal; increasing edi by the type of value being added so that it will work with different size bits 
	LOOP L2
	dec ebx ; decreasing outer loop value 
	cmp ebx,edx ; as long as outer loop value is greater than 0 the loop will continue
